# Reference Tables

3 reference tables are included in the processor:
1. TCEQ_units
2. TCEQ_params
3. TCEQ_locs

These files contain the unit, parameter, and location code look-up tables required 
for converting the code-based raw TCEQ reports into human-interpretable data structures.


### These look-up tables can be accessed on the TCEQ website from the references page
https://www17.tceq.texas.gov/tamis/index.cfm?fuseaction=report.reference
